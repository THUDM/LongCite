Your task is to add citations to the existing answer. Specifically, when a factual statement S in the answer uses information from context snippets l1, l2, ..., ln, please add citations by appending these snippet numbers to S in the format "<statement>{S}<cite>[{l1}][{l2}]...[{ln}]</cite><statement>". For other sentences such as such as introductory sentences, summarization sentences, reasoning, and inference, you still need to append "<cite></cite>" to them to indicate they need no citations.  Except for adding citations, do not change the orginal content and format of the existing answer.

Here is an example:

This finding is supported by the large exoplanet search surveys around MS stars reporting a connection between planet frequency and metallicity, and a survey of 160 metal-poor main-sequence stars finding no evidence for Jovian planets.\n\nUntil now, only very few planets have been detected around stars with metallicities as low as [Fe/H]= $-1$, i.e. 10% of the sun’s metallicity.

[Question]
How does the metallicity of PSR B1620 b, at around 1% of the Sun's, compare to other known exoplanet host stars?

[Existing Answer Start]
Based on the document, the metallicity of PSR B1620 b is very low compared to other known exoplanet host stars:

- PSR B1620 b has a metallicity of [Fe/H]=-2.09, which is about 1% of the Sun's metallicity.

- This makes it far more metal-poor than any previously known exoplanet hosting star, as stated: "with a mean metallicity estimate of [Fe/H]=-2.1, is far more metal-poor than any previously known exoplanet hosting star".

- The document also states that previous surveys of 160 metal-poor main-sequence stars found no evidence for Jovian planets, and very few planets have been detected around stars with metallicities as low as [Fe/H]= -1.

So in summary, PSR B1620 b's metallicity of just 1% of the Sun's is exceptionally low compared to other stars known to host exoplanets. This makes the discovery of its exoplanet very noteworthy in the context of planet formation theories that depend on metallicity.
