You will receive a passage and a factual statement. Your task is to identify the parts in the passage (i.e., chunks <C{s_1}>-<C{e_1}>, <C{s_2}>-<C{e_2}>, ..., <C{s_n}>-<C{e_n}>) that support some key points of the statement, and output the chunk number in the format:
'''
[s_1-e_1]
[s_2-e_2]
...
[s_n-e_n]
'''
If the passage contains no key information relevant to the statement, you must output "No relevant information".

Here are some examples:

<C0>In the last two decades, several hundred planets have been detected beyond our Solar-system. <C1>Most of these extra-solar planets orbit sun-like stars. <C2>A small number have been detected around stars that are in their late evolutionary state, such as Red Giant Branch (RGB) stars and pulsars. <C3>The phase directly after the RGB stage, the Horizontal Branch (HB), however, is still unexplored; therefore, there is no empirical evidence for whether close-in planets, i.e., those with semi-major axes less than 0.1 AU, survive the giant phase of their host stars. <C4>Besides its evolutionary stage, a star’s chemical composition appears to be a major indicator of its probability for hosting a planet. <C5>Previous studies, e.g.,, showed that main-sequence (MS) stars that host giant planets are metal-rich. <C6>This finding is supported by the large exoplanet search surveys around MS stars reporting a connection between planet frequency and metallicity, and a survey of 160 metal-poor main-sequence stars finding no evidence for Jovian planets. <C7>Until now, only very few planets have been detected around stars with metallicities as low as [Fe/H]= $-1$, i.e. 10% of the sun’s metallicity. <C8>The detection of PSR B1620 b, a Jovian planet orbiting a pulsar in the core of the metal-poor globular cluster M4 ([Fe/H]=$-1.2$), suggests, however, that planets may form around metal-poor stars, although the formation mechanism of this particular planet might be linked to the dense cluster environment.

[Statement]
The document also states that previous surveys of 160 metal-poor main-sequence stars found no evidence for Jovian planets, and very few planets have been detected around stars with metallicities as low as [Fe/H]= -1.

<C0>Cooloola Tramway\nThe Cooloola Tramway is a heritage-listed tramway at Great Sandy National Park, Cooloola Recreation Area, Cooloola, Gympie Region, Queensland, Australia. <C1>In the 1870s it was known as the Kaloola Railway. <C2>It is also known as Cooloola Railway, SEQ-5N 22, Pettigrew's Railway, and Pettigrew's Tramway. <C3>It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 12 July 2013.\n\n<C4>History \n\nWilliam Pettigrew's Cooloola timber operation began in the 1860s with the extraction of timber from Woolann (the area around Lake Poona). <C5>Bullock teams were used to drag Kauri pine logs to the mouth of Seary's Creek. <C6>The sandy nature of the terrain and lack of feed for horses and bullocks made traditional forms of timber transport unfeasible and Pettigrew had to find a solution to access the rich timber of inland Cooloola. <C7>The answer was the construction of a tramway: Cooloola Tramway opening in October 1873 as Queensland's first major private railway.\n\n<C8>Of all Queensland's natural resources \"timber was the most visible and abundant to the first Europeans\". <C9>Early European accounts of Queensland frequently refer to the extensive stands of timber which lined the coast and river banks. <C10>In south-east Queensland the dominant timber species were softwoods such as Hoop (Araucaria cunninghamii) and Kauri pine (Agathis robusta). <C11>When Moreton Bay was opened up to free settlement in 1842 the colony did not have a sawmill and logged timber was either pit sawn and used locally, or sent south for milling and/or export.\n\n<C12>The timber industry played a vital role in the economic development of Queensland and William Pettigrew was instrumental in this process. <C13>He was born in Ayrshire, Scotland, in 1825 and came to Moreton Bay in 1849 as one of Dr John Dunmore Lang's immigrants on board the.\n\n<C14>Pettigrew continued to seek out timber resources which could be milled at Dundathu. <C15>In September 1863, he set off in the paddle steamer Gneering to search for stands of timber that were reported to exist in the Noosa area. <C16>On his return Pettigrew concluded that the timber was disappointing and inaccessible. <C17>However, others did not agree and by the end of 1863, timber-getters were operating in the lower Noosa area. <C18>Pettigrew turned his attention to the north, and in late June 1865 Pettigrew landed at the head of Tin Can Bay to examine the area further.\n\n<C19>His discovery of Kauri pine in the Woolann area of north Cooloola provided the main source of timber for the Dundathu Sawmill. <C20>By 1865, Pettigrew's men were using bullock teams to drag Kauri pine logs from Woolann (the area around Lake Poona). <C21>Early timber-getters are recorded as using a corduroy crossing of tea-tree branches and saplings to cross the tidal flats in the northern Cooloola area. <C22>Pettigrew's men dragged the logs to the mouth of Seary's Creek, tied them into large rafts and towed them through the Tin Can Bay Inlet, Great Sandy Strait and up the Mary River. <C23>Tugs were then used to haul the rafts of timber to Dundathu.\n\n<C24>The sandy nature of the terrain and lack of feed for horses and bullocks made the use of draught animals for transport very difficult. <C25>Pettigrew needed to develop a more expedient alternative. <C26>In July 1865 Pettigrew noted in his diary that  of railway, the majority of which would cross flat, \"barren\" sandy country, would enable the timber to be taken out of inland Cooloola to Tin Can Bay. <C27>Pettigrew had previously written to Arthur Macalister-the Minister for Lands and Works-about a railway between his operations on the Maroochy and Mooloolah rivers, and was told that the government would not fund railways, and therefore they must be private.

[Statement]
Based on the doc, before they built the Cooloola Tramway, William Pettigrew and William Sim used bullock teams to drag Kauri pine logs from Woolann (the area around Lake Poona) to the mouth of Seary's Creek.
